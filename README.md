# Matchmatchphilly  

Match Match Philly will integrate the City of Philadelphia's engagement data collection system (VAN) with its volunteer recruitment tool (VolunteerMatch). The City is moving to track all engagement data with this tool to increase data sharing and improve the way departments track and conduct engagement. This integration will enable seamless tracking and management of volunteer recruitment data.

This app is designed to be used by a single City of Philadelphia employee who will download the new information into VAN for the use of other city employees, therefore a complex database structure was not needed for security  -- that is why our back-end developers (Luke McKinstry, Eric Ruan) choose Flask. 

It was easy to use Bootstrap on the front end after initial wireframes and the user story was told through sketches (Suzanne Hunter). See the files MMP-whitebdsketch.jpg and WireframeOfResultspage.pdf in this directory for UI development processes.


The idea for this app was promoted and managed by City of Philadelphia employee, Jacki Boone.

For a UI demonstration go to https://sue-hntr.github.io/matchmatchphilly/. This fork of MatchMatch Philly is not connected to the database, but you can observe the instructions and different pages by clicking through on the major buttons (Sign-In, Upload). The Results page especially was designed with accessability in mind -- color plays a minor role and all messages are in text, rather than icons.


Please note that the UI pages for Match Match Philly have been placed in the main directory ONLY FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.
